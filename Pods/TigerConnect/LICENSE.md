License.
Evaluation License Grant. Subject to Subscriber’s adherence to this Agreement, TigerText grants Subscriber, a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, non-transferrable, non-assignable, and non-sublicensable license within the United States of America for Subscriber to access and use the Services solely for the purpose of evaluating the Platform for use with Subscriber’s own proprietary application (“Subscriber’s Application”). Under this evaluation license grant, Subscriber is not permitted to commercially exploit Subscriber’s Application nor may Subscriber send messages via the Platform in quantities that TigerText determines, in its sole discretion, to exceed those needed to evaluate the Services. Should Subscriber wish to utilize the Services for commercial purposes, Subscriber must contact TigerText at tigerconnect@tigertext.com to receive pricing and other necessary terms and conditions.
Access Credentials. Subscriber may receive from TigerText an API key & secret and/or an SDK credential (the “Keys”). Subscriber is solely responsible for the security of the Keys, and shall be responsible for any unauthorized access to the Keys or Subscriber’s account.
Term & Termination.
Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and will continue so long as Subscriber uses the Services. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately without penalty upon notice to the other party.
Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted hereunder will automatically terminate and Subscriber will immediately cease using the Services and will return or delete any Content and Confidential Information (as defined herein). Upon termination, Subscriber’s Application will no longer function and TigerText may delete any data provided by Subscriber or its end users. Sections 3(c), 5, 6, 7 and 8 will survive termination of this Agreement.
Updates.
Updates. TigerText may update or revise the Services and/or Platform from time to time and such updates and revisions (“Updates”) may adversely affect Subscriber’s Application access to or communication with the Platform or features enabled by the Platform. Subscriber, at its sole expense, is responsible for making any changes required as a result of Updates. TigerText may, but is not obligated to, provide 30 days’ advance notice via posting on its developer site of any Updates that are not backward compatible or remove significant functionality; provided, if TigerText must make an immediate change, TigerText will attempt to provide Subscriber with as much advance notice as commercially possible.
Subscriber’s Responsibilities.
No Reverse Engineering. The Platform constitutes and/or contains trade secrets of TigerText and its licensors. Subscriber shall not disassemble, decompile or otherwise reverse engineer the Services and/or Platform, in whole or in part, or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent such activities are expressly permitted by law notwithstanding this prohibition.
Other Restrictions.
Subscriber may not distribute the Services and/or Platform on a stand-alone basis, and subscriber’s application must provide material functionality in addition to the Services and/or Platform. Subscriber may not sell, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the Platform to any third party, make the functionality of the Platform available to multiple users through any means, including, without limitation, by uploading the Platform to a network or file-sharing service or through any hosting, application services provider, service bureau or any other type of services. Subscriber shall only deploy the Services and/or Platform to the extent necessary to evaluate the Services and Platform.

Upon termination of this Agreement, Subscriber shall cease from the use of any Marks. Any goodwill generated by use of the Marks will inure to the benefit of TigerText.

Subscriber must abide by any limitations on access, calls, and use of the Services and/or Platform (such as rate limiting) (“Use Limits”) that are set by TigerText. Use Limits are set forth in the Documentation or will be otherwise communicated to Subscriber. Subscriber may not attempt to circumvent Use Limits without TigerText’s prior written consent. If Subscriber exceeds Use Limits (or TigerText believes that Subscriber has attempted to do so) Subscriber’s ability to access the Services and/or use the Services may be temporarily or permanently blocked. TigerText may monitor Subscriber’s access and use of the Services to ensure Subscriber’s compliance with this Agreement.
Subscriber may not (and will not attempt to) interfere, by-pass, or disable any features or functionality that is embedded or included with the Services and/or Platform, including, without limitation, the reporting of any data, usage statistics or other information regarding Subscriber’s access and use of the Services and/or Platform.

Subscriber shall properly direct and control its affiliates and its and its affiliates’ respective directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors and any other persons or entities who contribute to the performance of such party’s obligations under this Agreement. Subscriber shall be responsible for such parties: (i) conduct, actions and omissions; (ii) compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, to at least the extent that they would be responsible if it were performing directly; and (iii) management and coordination of their performance. Any breach of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by any such party shall be deemed a direct breach by Subscriber.
Source Code. In addition to and without limiting any other obligation hereunder, Subscriber: (a) acknowledges that the source code (including, without limitation, source documentation) of TigerText’s software is extremely valuable, highly-confidential property of TigerText: and (b) shall not disclose or provide access to source code or source code modified or translated or adapted therefrom and will undertake best efforts to protect source code from unauthorized use or disclosure.
Privacy Policy. The use of the Messaging Infrastructure by Subscriber and its end users through Subscriber’s Application is covered by the terms and conditions set forth in TigerText’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.tigertext.com; provided, however, to the extent there is a conflict between the Privacy Policy and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

If Subscriber provides TigerText with any feedback regarding the Services, TigerText may use all such feedback without restriction and shall not be subject to any non-disclosure or non-use obligations in respect of such feedback. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to provide Subscriber any rights in the Services and/or Platform except the limited license to use the Services as set forth herein.

Open Source. The use, reproduction and distribution of components of the Services and/or Platform licensed under a third party license (including, without limitation, any open source software licenses) are governed solely by the terms of that third party license and not this Agreement.
